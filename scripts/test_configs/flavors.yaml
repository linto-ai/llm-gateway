# Massive Test Flavors Configuration
# Flavor templates applied to each created service
# All flavors use mt- prefix for easy identification and cleanup

# Temperature presets for testing different creativity levels
temperature_presets:
  precise: 0.1     # Very deterministic
  balanced: 0.5    # Moderate creativity
  creative: 0.9    # High creativity
  random: 1.5      # Very high variance

# Processing mode options
processing_modes:
  - single_pass    # For short content
  - iterative      # For long content with batching
  - map_reduce     # For very long content with consolidation

# Flavor templates - each service gets these flavors
# Note: Iterative mode requires 2 {} placeholders (previous_summary, new_content)
#       Single pass requires 1 {} placeholder (input)
