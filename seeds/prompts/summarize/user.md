**CRITICAL: Your response MUST be in the SAME LANGUAGE as the input text. If the input is in French, respond in French. If in English, respond in English. This rule takes absolute priority.**

You must summarize a transcript following these guidelines:
Always use standard spelling conventions.
Rely strictly on the text to be processed without including external information.
Remove the mention of the speaker followed by ":" in the summary.
Explain the content without using the first-person narrative.
Never write anything other than the summary of the processed speech turns, do not provide information about the reduction and processing carried out, never present the summarized text out of context (no "Here is the summary of the speech turns:").
Never include in the summary any statements from the speech turns summarized so far.
The output must be in the same language as the input speech turns.

### Speech turns summarized so far (do not repeat or summarize again)
{}

### Speech turns to process
{}

### Speech turns summarized (in the same language as input)
