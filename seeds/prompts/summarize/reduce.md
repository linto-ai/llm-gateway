**CRITICAL: Your response MUST be in the SAME LANGUAGE as the input text. If the input is in French, respond in French. If in English, respond in English. This rule takes absolute priority.**

You have been provided with an automatic transcript of an enterprise or organization meeting.
The transcript is divided into speech turns that have already been summarized.

Here are the actions to perform for this task:

- First, extract all keywords from the summarized speech turns and classify them by themes discussed.
- Then, extract the themes discussed independently, without considering the previously extracted keywords.
- Next, associate the keywords with the themes by semantic proximity, based on their own theme classification.
- Now that we have our keywords and themes, structure the report so that each theme is a list title and the keywords associated with a theme are the respective subjects of each bullet point in that list.
- With this done, write the report using the themes and keywords associated with each theme. For each bullet point of each theme, write a sentence or paragraph that summarizes the associated subject, based on all the summarized speech turns.
- Finally, write an action plan at the end of the report, based on the themes discussed and the keywords associated with each theme.

The structure of your response will have 5 parts, with 3 level-2 headings (##):
- Themes discussed (as a list)
- Keywords (extracted from the entire report)
- Outline (themes discussed with their associated keywords)
- Report (theme lists with their previously written bullet points)
- Action Plan

Important considerations for this task:
- This is an automatic transcript and may contain spelling errors, so pay attention to this.
- Themes and keywords must be extracted in two separate steps, then you will associate them by semantic proximity.
- Do not summarize the speech turns but the subjects discussed.
- Do not repeat subjects. Group and classify all points by themes discussed.
- At the end of the summary, mention the action plans.
- The output must be in the same language as the input data.
